# CS701 Reactive CoProcessor Re-COP
This is our implementation of a 4 Stage Reactive CoProcessor (ReCOP). It implements the ReCOP Instruction Set Architecture and is synthesized on a DE1-SOC FPGA. We have successfully managed to implement instructions such as Load, Store, ALU Operations and instructions such as LSIP (Read Signal Input) and SSOP (Send Signal Output), making it able to react to and influence external signals, to be used in a digital signal processing pipeline. 

# How to start
Instructions are to be entered in the .asm file found in recop/assembler. Run assembler.py to generate .mif file. Instruction format is identical to that of the given instruction set.

# Running Testbench
1. Open recop/recop.qpf and run analysis and synthesis. 
2. Go to _Processing -> update memory initialization file._ Whenever instructions are updated this is a necessary step to ensure the correct file version has been uploaded.
3. Set Recop.bdf as the top level entity and perform analysis and synthesis. 
4. Open _recopWaveform.vwf_ and press simulation, run functional simulation to see testbench. 
5. Simulation can be run for longer to see more instructions, clock is at 10ns.


### Note
* In case there is an error or you are unable to run the simulation, ensure you create a testbench first and copy the files over to the qsim.
* Additionally, ensure that going to _simulation -> simulation settings_ and restoring defualt settings has occurred to reset any versions of file path.

# Demoing FPGA Implementation
To demo, set top level entity to _top_level_block_, update Memory Initialisation File if necessary and compile and program. Inputs and outputs are shown below; 

## Outputs
- SOP will be indicated by LEDs. 
- SOP_WR will be indicated by an LED.
- DPCR_WR will be indicated by an LED.
- DPCR[19..0] will be indicated via display

## Inputs
- KEY0 acts as a reset, will reset PC, DPCR and SOP to 0.
- SIP[9..0] can be configured via SW[9..0].
