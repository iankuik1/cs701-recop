Info (119006): Selected device 5CSEMA5F31C6 for design "recop"
Warning (18236): Number of processors has not been specified which may cause overloading on shared machines.  Set the global assignment NUM_PARALLEL_PROCESSORS in your QSF to an appropriate value for best performance.
Error (204012): Can't generate netlist output files because the file "C:/Users/ianku/OneDrive/Documents/Github/cs701-recop/recop/NOC/synthesis/submodules/NOC_cpu_cpu.v" is an OpenCore Plus time-limited file. Remove the unlicensed cores or obtain a license for those OpenCore Plus time-limited IP cores used in the design. The Intel FPGA Knowledge Database contains many articles with specific details on how to resolve this error. Visit the Knowledge Database at https://www.altera.com/support/support-resources/knowledge-base/search.html and search for this specific error message number.
Error (204009): Can't generate netlist output files because the license for encrypted file "C:/Users/ianku/OneDrive/Documents/Github/cs701-recop/recop/NOC/synthesis/submodules/NOC_cpu_cpu.v" is not available
